    <h1>installation</h1>
    <!-- Page published by Emacs Muse begins here -->
<p>The installation of NClosEmacs is a simple manual process of moving
files to appropriate directories and loading the master
<code>nclose.el</code> ELisp file (once) from within Emacs.</p>

<p>The quick instructions herein have been tested under Windows, Cygwin
and Linux.</p>

<h2>Downloading and Installing NClosEmacs</h2>

<p class="first">A tarball is available for download at the Google code repository
under the <a href="http://code.google.code/p/nclosemacs">nclosemacs</a> project header.  The archive contains ELisp
files, with the .el extension, and an Emacs info file
<code>nclosemacs.info</code>.  They are installed separately.</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a directory to contain the ELisp files (as well as some of
the rule base example files provided in the archive), say
<code>/home/nclose</code>.</li>
<li>Move or untar all ELisp (.el) files in the newly created directory</li>
<li>In your <code>.emacs</code> file add the nclose directory to the
load path Emacs will use by adding the following line:</li>
</ul>

<pre class="example">
(add-to-list 'load-path &quot;/home/nclose&quot;)
</pre>

<p>This completes the basic installation of NClosEmacs to work with
Emacs or XEmacs, under Windows, Cygwin and Linux.</p>

<p>At any time during an Emacs session, the NClose inference engine may
be loaded by the usual load file command: <code>M-x load-file
nclose.el</code>.  Rule bases are edited as text files in standard
Emacs buffers and loaded in memory&mdash;once the NClose engine itself has
been loaded&mdash;by simply evaluting the buffer with the usual command
<code>M-x eval-current-buffer</code>.</p>

<p>If required the loading of the expert system inference engine may also
be expedited at Emacs launch by adding the following line to the
<code>~/.emacs</code> initialization file:</p>

<pre class="example">
(load-file &quot;nclose.el&quot;)
</pre>

<p>NClosEmacs' manual and user interface are described in the
documentation provided in info, PDF, and HTML formats, in the same
<code>release</code> directory.</p>


<h2>Installing the NClosEmacs documentation</h2>

<p class="first">The documentation is also provided as an info file to be installed
directly in the Emacs info facility, invoked with <code>M-x
info</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Locate the <code>dir</code> info directory file for your Emacs
installation.  In Cygwin, for instance, it is usually found in the
<code>/usr/share/info</code> directory.</li>
<li>Edit this file to insert the following line under the appropriate
section:</li>
</ul>

<pre class="example">
 * NClose: (/home/nclose/nclosemacs). An expert system for Emacs.
</pre>
with the proper location of the <code>nclosemacs.info</code> file in
parentheses.

<p>The documentation then becomes available as a standard part of the
info system in Emacs.</p>


<h2>Information</h2>

<p class="first">NClosEmacs is released under the GNU GPL v3, the text of which is
available in this archive as <code>gpl-3.0.txt</code>.</p>

<p>NClosEmacs has been tested with Emacs 21-3 under Windows and Cygwin,
<blockquote>
<p class="quoted">with Emacs 22.2 under Windows, and with XEmacs 21-4 under Cygwin.</p>
</blockquote>
