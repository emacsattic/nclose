Overview
********

This document describes NClosEmacs, a tentative implementation of the
NClose rules engine in ELisp for embedding expert system functionality
in the Emacs environment.

   In addition, this implementation is experimental in that it
investigates the use of _modern_ programming approaches in this new
implementation, most of which were only budding when NClose itself was
designed in the early eighties.

   As such, it is still with a certain pride, after all these years,
that I qualify the following work as research in progress.

1 Introduction and historical background
****************************************

NClose is an original evaluation algorithm designed for research on
rule-based systems, with which specific domain applications in Medicine
were explored in the mid-eighties, at the Robotics Institute,
Carnegie-Mellon University.

   At that time NClose emerged as a first result in an effort to pursue
the development of computer programs capable of displaying (hopefully)
intelligent problem-solving behaviour.  This approach to Artificial
Intelligence was unsurprisingly inspired from the prevalent school of
thought at CMU led by Allen Newell and Herbert Simon.  Work by Newell,
"The Knowledge Level"
(http://www.aaai.org/aitopics/assets/PDF/AIMag02-02-001.pdf) in
particular, but research at MIT driven by Pete Szolovits, "Artificial
Intelligence in Medicine"
(http://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/ftp/AIM82/), for instance,
and at Stanford with authors such as Buchanan, Feigenbaum, Shortliffe
and Fagan also proved inspirational, specifically in relation to domain
applications.

   A second angle which drove these early research effort was the
realisation that "rules" or "productions" could be envisioned as both
representing _computation_ elements, within a computer science
perspective, and _knowledge_ units, in the larger cognitive sciences
framework which was budding from AI research at the time.  This duality
of views in itself provided an exploratory bridge between computing
processes and cognitive behaviour which, with the upcoming availability
of PCs and graphical user interfaces, readily lent itself to an
experimental mode of research.

   From the late eighties to the late nineties, this experimental mode
would morph into more implementation-oriented work, culminating in the
very successful releases of a series of commercial tools and
environments at the front edge of the then nascent major trends in an
emerging software industry: graphical user interfaces and
object-oriented programming languages, which are both now firmly
established as our common base infrastructure.

   Over time several implementations of the base NClose algorithm were
developed in various programming languages including LISP (MacLisp,
LeLisp, and ZetaLisp chiefly), and later Pascal, C and C++.  NClose
evaluation constituted the core of the rule engine found in the
commercial products Nexpert, and Nexpert Object, released by Neuron
Data from 1985 onward.

2 NClose in Emacs
*****************

This package contains a preliminary implementation of NClose in ELisp,
the dialect of the Lisp programming language used in both GNU Emacs and
XEmacs (collectively called Emacs in this document).  Users of Emacs
commonly write ELisp code to extend and to customize Emacs as they
require.

   This document does not dwell on the NClose algorithm itself, a formal
description of which can be found in Rappaport and Chauvet, 1984
(http://www.ri.cmu.edu/pubs/pub_77.html), and rather focuses on several
facets of its implementation in ELisp, with emphasis on the
experimental approach to this revisited development.

   This implementation departs from the somewhat older implementations
in early pre-Common Lisp dialects (namely MacLisp and ZetaLisp) which
was leveraged in our AI research work.  In particular, ELisp offers
"advising functions" which are useful for Aspect Oriented Programming
(AOP).  AOP, which originated with Gregor Kiczales at Xerox PARC, helps
programmers separate so-called cross-cutting concerns, i.e.
functionality which has an impact on all the functions of a program,
from the program code itself.  (Logging is the traditional example of a
cross-cutting concern.)  The AOP flavor provided by advising functions
in Emacs prompted revisiting the NClose algorithm with an eye towards
proper identification of cross-cutting concerns.

   Another revision of the original design ideas behind NClose was
deemed necessary as Emacs is, for all purposes of this implementation,
the unique communication channel with the end-user.  As one of the
distinguishing features of NClose, and the ensuing Nexpert
implementations and commercial products, is precisely its handling of
user interactions, the embedding into Emacs both restricted and
enhanced what we used to implement in windowing environments and
graphical user interfaces.  Living in Emacs, text naturally becomes the
primary user interface through which commands are issued and knowledge
bases loaded and run.  Special buffers play roles otherwise devolved to
windows or menus in previous implementations.  New usages may be
envisioned where knowledge-driven problem solving seamlessly blends
into text documents produced by the user.

   The following sections provide an overview of the design options
selected in the current NClosEmacs implementation.

2.1 ELisp Implementation
========================

The main implementation file is `nclose.el'.  It loads the various
ELisp files required, installs a new major mode for NClose rule bases
and inits the rules engine.

   Each large functional chunk is implemented in its own ELisp file
named somewhat after its main role in the NClose algorithm.  More
detailed explanations may be found in *Note Implementation::.

   NClosEmacs relies on the ELisp evaluator for its rules evaluation
engine.  Each piece of data in the left- and right-hand sides of rules,
usually called _signs_, _variables_ or simply _data_ in the rest of the
document, and each _hypothesis_ is actually implemented as an ELisp
symbol.  This means that the value of a sign is obtained by typing its
name at the top level Lisp listener.  For instance:
`ACETATE-CYPROTERONE' and `(eval 'ACETATE-CYPROTERONE)' both return the
value of the sign ACETATE-CYPROTERONE.  Unknown signs are simply
unbound ELisp symbols.

   Another nice consequence of the reuse of the evaluator is that
conditions patterns in left-hand sides may be expressed directly in
Lisp.  Similarly actions in the righ-hand sides may use Lisp functions
directly.  Pattern evaluation uses the error signalling mechanism of
ELisp to trigger backward chaining if the unbound sign encountered is
in fact an hypothesis, or a question to the user if simply a sign.  In
`unify.el' the basic LHS evaluation is as follows:


     (defun nclose-get-unification (pattern)
       "Interactive unification of pattern"
       (condition-case error
           (eval pattern)
         (void-variable
          (sign-writer (cadr error) (sign-reader (cadr error)))
          ;; Recurse
          (nclose-get-unification pattern)
         )
         )
     )

   The idea is that when the (Lisp) evaluation of the pattern fails on
an unbound symbol, the error catching mechanism considers it as an
unknown sign or hypothesis and accordingly assigns a value read
possibly interactively, and retries.  This process recursively
evaluates all required signs in the LHS to produce the final
unification result, here a true or false value.

   The `sign-writer' and `sign-reader' high level getter/setter
functions for signs are separately coded as they may be advised in
order to implement side-effects.

   Similarly a rule RHS is passed to the Lisp evaluator for execution
with the sequence of Lisp forms implicitly and-ed, as in:


     (defun and-eval-rhs (rhs)
       "Recursively execute the sequential execution of RHS forms"
       (cond
        ((null rhs) t)
        (t (and (eval (car rhs)) (and-eval-rhs (cdr rhs))))
        )
     )

   This works provided all RHS operators are pre-defined to call the
advised functions if necessary.  This is in particular the case for the
ubiquitous `@SET' operator which expects exactly a sign as its first
argument and a value as the second argument.  In the file `rhs.el',
this operator, for instance, is implemented as a Lisp macro:


     (defmacro @set (var val)
       "External RHS assignment operator"
       (progn (sign-writer var (nclose-get-unification val)) t)
     )

   This example implementation of a RHS operator shows the important
features to keep in mind.  Execution indeed returns a boolean value;
remember the implicit and in the sequence of RHS forms execution.
Returning `nil' would stop further execution of the RHS. (This crude
control mechanism could be useful to an advising function for instance.)

   The RHS value assignment itself is a two-step process: the value is
computed, which may entail asking the user for input, hence the call to
the generic `nclose-get-unification' evaluation/unification function
also used in LHS patterns evaluation; and then it is assigned to the
said sign through the standard setter, which as previously mentioned
may itself be advised.

   Other domain-specific operators may be developed by following the
same simple design method.  An interesting possibility is, of course,
to call Emacs' text and buffer functions from the RHS of NClose rules,
opening up a whole scope of applications with text documents
co-produced, in form or content or both, by the user and a rule-based
expert system.

2.2 Aspect Oriented Programming
===============================

The experimental part of this new implementation of NClose relies on
using Aspect Oriented Programming ideas, and more specifically a recent
evolution known as Context Oriented Programming
(http://www.swa.hpi.uni-postdam.de/cop/), where different cross-cutting
concerns are implemented in _layers_ separately activated as needed.

   Although not all features of NClose were yet reviewed for this
version of the implementation, at least two were immediately identified
as appropriate candidates for an AOP approach:

   * Gating: the core NClose forward chaining process

   * Logging: keeping a trace of the expert system session execution

   The "gating" process in NClose is a form of forward chaining, going
from known signs or data to hypotheses.  In contrast to RETE-like
implementations where individual conditions in separate rules are
compiled into a automate network, with known data acting as tokens
moving from one vertex to another as they match the condition node, the
somewhat simpler implementation in NClose uses a "gate", which, when a
sign becomes known, decides which hypotheses should be posted for later
evaluation.

   In order to implement gating, a gating-layer is created as a series
of advising functions in ELisp.  Given that the core backward chaining
is implemented through an agenda, a last-in first-out stack of
hypotheses posted for evaluation in bacward chaining mode, the
gating-layer addresses concerns:

   * initialization time, for the setup of the data structures
     responsible for handling gating;

   * rule compilation, to handle dependencies between hypotheses and
     signs discovered when parsing LHSes;

   * execution time, each time a value is assigned to a piece of data,
     i.e. when it becomes known.

   The layer is hence implemented as three advising functions, gathered
with other layers in the `advice.el' file.  The following advising
function, for instance:


     (defadvice sign-compile (after gating-layer (sign hypo))
       "Builds the forward association list, hypo is nil when RHS are compiled"
       (if hypo (plist-push sign hypo))
     )

   advises the `sign-compile' function, called at rule compilation
time, and adds the rule's hypothesis to the parsed sign forward
association list.  This forward association list is later used, at
runtime, to push hypotheses on the agenda when signs become known.

   In order to implement a minimal logging facility, another layer is
implemented in `advice.el'.  The functions in this layer simply advise
all of the interactive command functions, keeping track of all
interactions with the user, as well as the evaluation functions,
keeping trace of the expert system's deductions as the session
progresses.  These traces are stored in a special Emacs buffer named
`*nclose-log*' and addressable through the usual set of Emacs buffer
commands.

   Advising functions are enabled and activated by default in the same
file:


     ;; Enable/Disable layers as required
     (ad-enable-regexp "gating-layer")
     (ad-enable-regexp "log-layer")

     ;; Activate advising functions
     (ad-activate-regexp "gating-layer")
     (ad-activate-regexp "log-layer")

   other variations are of course possible, since Emacs' advising
functions may be enabled and disabled using regexp patterns rather than
names.

2.3 Front End
=============

The front-end of this NClose implementation is unsurprisingly
text-oriented and well-integrated with Emacs.  The purpose of the
default front-end is to assist in the authoring and running of rule
bases from within Emacs.

   The NClose rules engine is manually loaded by issuing the standard
Emacs command `M-x load-file' on the master NClose `nclose.el' file
(with the .elc extension if it has been compiled at installation).
This may also be placed in the `.emacs' initialization file.

   The rule base itself is a text document edited in a standard Emacs
buffer.  *Note Authoring Knowledge Bases::, for the actual syntax of
rules declarations.  The user "loads" a rule base in memory simply by
evaluating the buffer containing its text, the `M-x
eval-current-buffer' in Emacs.

   NClose provides a number of commands, implemented as interactive
ELisp functions invoked through the usual `M-x' prefix to setup and run
an expert session.  In addition, traces and execution logs may be
provided in NClose-specific buffers such as `*nclose-log*'.

   The `nclose.el' file also provides a minimal major mode for
text-based rule bases.  At this stage, the major mode is only concerned
with highlighting the inference process as it progresses through the
rule base.  Hypotheses under evaluation are highlighted as they are
pushed and popped from the agenda; their final status, true or false,
is color-coded.  NClose keywords are also font-locked for easier
readability.  (The NClose major mode is still pretty much experimental
and additional features may be added as the implementation is revised.)

3 Authoring Knowledge Bases
***************************

Rule bases for NClose are simple text documents which can be edited in
Emacs.  These rule base text documents follow the Lisp syntax
conventions, and more specifically the ELisp conventions.  Comments
lines begin with the `;' character.  The body of the rule base is
constituted of well-balanced Lisp forms, one for each rule in the
knowledge base.

* Designing classes and objects::


File: nclosemacs.info,  Node: Writing rules,  Next: Designing classes and objects,  Prev: Authoring Knowledge Bases,  Up: Authoring Knowledge Bases

3.1 Writing rules
=================

NClose provides a high-level Lisp macro to declare a rule.


     (add-to-kb
       (@LHS= *pattern-lisp-form*)
       (@hypo *hypothesis*)
       [(@RHS= [*RHS-lisp-form*]+) *string-documentation*]
     )

   The macro parses four arguments, the last two being optional:

   * _pattern-lisp-form_ is a lisp form expressing a boolean computation
     with an ultimate true/false value.  It usually is an AND/OR tree of
     several elementary conditions involving any of the standard Lisp
     functions, namely: `(string= < > = /= >= <= + - * / and or not
     null yes no Yes No)'.  Any other symbol in the pattern is
     considered as sign and compiled as such by the rule compiler.

   * _hypothesis_ is the hypothesis for the rule.

   * Optionally, _RHS-lisp-form_ is one of possibly several right-hand
     side actions.  Currently the only NClose specific RHS action is the
     `(@SET *sign* *expression*)' operator used to assign a value
     (_expression_) to a sign.  Other Lisp functions in a RHS action
     are passed without modification to the Lisp evaluator.

   * _string-documentation_ is an optional textual description attached
     to the rule.

   For instance the following are examples or well-formed, if
meaningful, rules:


     (add-to-kb (@LHS= (and (> a 2) (string= foo "hello"))) (@hypo H3)
     	(@RHS= (@set frob (* 2 a)) (@set boz "test")) "Another
     comment")

     (add-to-kb (@if (> boz 0)) (@hypo H3))

     (add-to-kb (@if (and (> a c) (< (* d 5) 10))) (@hypo H2)
     	nil "Commenting this H2 rule")

3.2 Designing classes and objects
=================================

Still an area of research and experimental implementation work.

   The introduction of a simple yet rich object system in Nexpert was
the major transition between the original version and the later Nexpert
Object.  This transition happened as early as 1986-87, at a time when
object-oriented programming languages were beginning to vie for
developers' attention and frame-based and object systems were still an
active area of AI research.

   While object-oriented languages became mainstream, object systems
faded from the main AI research efforts only to find renewed attention
in so-called _middleware_, with COM/DCOM from Microsoft and the Object
Management Group's Corba/IIOP specifications being the major industry
beacons during the early nineties.  Although these were somewhat
superseded later on in the decade by the emergence of Web
protocols-based middleware using XML (SOAP/WSDL and the plethora of WS-
specifications) they played role model in the development of the Web
Services stack.

   Today, with the Semantic Web initiative at the W3C--albeit making
slow progress in industry adoption--object systems are again under
active study and development.  The crux of the on-going Semantic Web
matter lies in the definition and use-cases of _ontologies_.  Proposals
differ on the expressivity of ontology specifications, on their actual
representation, and on their articulation with deductive systems of
various kinds--mostly based on first-order logic.  Two important
ontology systems in broad use today are the W3C-promoted RDF/OWL and
Topic Maps.  Another unrelated initiative, dubbed _microformats_, is
more interested in in-page data formatting for automated collection and
analysis.

3.2.1 The NClosEmacs articulation between rule and object systems
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The important innovation in the transition from Nexpert to Nexpert
Object was in the elegant articulation between the rule and the object
systems.  On the one hand the object system supported _classes_, defined
as collections of _properties_, and inheritance along two relations:
_subClassOf_ and _instanceOf_, respectively from class to class(es) and
from class to object(s).  A third relation, from object to object(s),
defined as _partOf_, allowed two hierarchies (class to subclasses with
objects as leaves, and object to subobjects) to mingle in Nexpert
ontologies.

   The system was designed as quite dynamic in nature and weakly
reinforced hierarchical relations, in contrast to object-oriented
programming languages--and more in par with the then AI-styled, and now
Semantic Web research.  Objects could sport additional properties to
the set of inherited ones; exceptions in default inheritance mechanisms
could be provided; objects could be moved from class to class; objects
could be created by rules' RHS actions, and so forth.

   The articulation between rules and objects basically enabled LHS of
rules to query the object system for a set of subsets of objects
matching simple patterns and RHS to act upon this set of subsets.  The
syntax for expressing patterns was very compact and represented classes
as set of their instances, and objects as sets of their subobjects with
LHS patterns being either set operations such as membership or
intersections, or scalar typed tests on properties.

   In the NClosEmacs proposed implementation we are trying to abstract
out simple design principles from the original ideas in Nexpert Object
to layer an object system over the NClose rule engine.

   * The "static" part of the object system, the base ontology, should
     minimally provide classes and objects with two hierarchical
     relations (namely class/subclass and object/subobject, usually
     specialization and mereological).  Inheritance mechanisms are
     overlayed on the object system ontology.

   * The "dynamic" part of the object system, is the definition of the
     query language (patterns) used in rules LHSes and the
     object-related operations in the rules RHSes.

   Note that, in addition, the unification step should now collect set
of subsets of objects, or list of _scopes_, to be passed from the LHS to
the RHS.

   In the vein of contemporary systems we are interested in using
NClosEmacs knowledge-based applications on modern ontology
representations.  So we plan again to separate concerns and provide for
different ontology representations together with an abstract API for
user-defined ontology representations--which may be required for
domain-specific applications, e.g. health/medicine applications.

   In NCLosEmacs the interchangeable ontology modules are called _nclos_
for NClosEmacs Ontology/Object System.

   NClosEmacs comes with three ontology modules:

   * A default ontology with no inheritance which relies heavily on the
     underlying Lisp evaluator and specifically on atom property lists,
     *Note The Default Object System in NClosEmacs::

   * An ontology representation based on OWL-Lite
     (http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/) where classes and objects are
     described using the OWL-Lite conventions, *Note The OWL-Lite
     Object System in NClosEmacs::

   * An ontology representation based on Topic Maps
     (http://www.topicmaps.org) where classes and objects of NClosEmacs
     are represented as such.

   Both OWL-Lite and XTM (Topic Maps) ontology representations offer a
much more expressive environment for ontologies than the original
Nexpert Object object system.  The current implementation is only a
basis for further research work inasmuch as the minimal feature set for
NClosEmacs was imported from OWL-Lite and Topic Maps.  Augmenting the
pattern/action language to leverage their additional expressive power
constitute an open area for further research.  (The implementation
could use Emacs advising functions, for instance.)

3.2.2 The Default Object System in NClosEmacs
---------------------------------------------

The default object system in NClosEmacs uses the underlying ELisp
variables and evaluator to represent, store and access objects.
Individual objects are ELisp variables, and their individual properties
and values are stored in the symbol's property list itself. Classes are
not distinguished from composite objects (superobjects) in this default
nclos; there is no inheritance or derivation mechanism.  Classes are
using lists as simple set representations.

   The default nclos is installed by invoking:


     (nclose-use-nclos nil)
   at the beginning of the knowledge base file.

   Note that by default the default nclos is installed the first time
NClosEmacs is loaded.  After the default nclos installation, classes
and objects are simply defined by the add-to-kb-sets statement in the
knowledge base:


         (add-to-kb-sets 'Ca  '(O1 O2 O3))
         (add-to-kb-sets 'Cb  '(O4 O5))

   These two statements define two classes, "Ca" and "Cb" respectively.
The first class has three instances, namely objects "O1", "O2" and
"O3".  The class Cb has two instances: objects "O4" and "O5".

   In the default nclos objects' properties do not require definitions
as the properties and the objects they attach to are actually derived
from the rule parsing phase.  As a consequence the simple ontology
model supported by the default nclos is a collection of sets, or
classes, of individual objects, with no inheritance but dynamical
property lists for each object.

* Writing Rules with Patterns in the default nclos::
* Writing Rules with RHSes in the Default Nclos::

Writing Rules with Patterns in the default nclos
................................................

With each nclos systems comes a set of specific LHS query operators and
a related set of RHS commands to be used in rules.  In addition to
matching LHS conditions, the inference engine is also required to
_unify_ patterns and subsets of objects in the ontology.  A pattern in a
rule LHS can be seen as a query against to the ontology which returns
a, possibly empty, set of objects.  Hence the unification of a LHS not
only returns _true_ or _nil_ to indicate whether all of its conditions
are matched or not, but, in addition, a _result set_ accumulating all
the subsets of objects that matched its patterns.

   When the LHS is matched, this result set is passed to the rule RHS
where object-specific commands can operate upon these sets and their
individual object members.

   In the default nclos there are basically two major patterns: _all_
and _some_, which query an individual class for all its instances
matching a given condition.  The general form of a pattern is:


         (all-in 'CLASS-NAME INTEGER 'AND-OR-ELISP-FORM)

   and


         (some-in 'CLASS-NAME INTEGER 'AND-OR-ELISP-FORM)

   The first pattern (_universal_) is true when all instances of the
said class match the lisp form passed as the last argument.  Its result
set is simply the list of instances of the said class.

   The second pattern (_existence_) is true when some, i.e. at least
one, instances of the said class match the lisp form passed as the last
argument.  Its result set is the subset of this class instances that
actually matched the test lisp form.

   Note the integer second argument passed in both patterns.  This is
the index of the subset in the rule global result set, on which the
query should be applied.  Several patterns in the same rule LHS may
refer to the same index; they then act as successive filters on the
subset resulting on previous pattern-matching queries on the same index.

   In the third argument AND-OR-ELISP-FORM, each free ELisp variable is
considered a _property_, defined on all instances of the class passed as
the second argument.  These "dynamic" properties are created and added
to objects' representations on an as-needed basis, by adding them to
the ELisp variable symbol property list on the fly.

   Let's look at a few examples.


     (add-to-kb-sets 'Ca  '(O1 O2 O3))
     (add-to-kb-sets 'Cb  '(O4 O5))

     (add-to-kb
      (@if (and (> x 0)
     	   (and (all-in 'Ca 1 '(or (> p1 0) (> p2 0)))
     		(some-in 'Ca 1 '(> p3 5)))))
      (@hypo H)
     )

   This knowledge base defines two classes, Ca and Cb, as before and
adds one rule with a LHS containing two patterns, the first one being an
universal pattern on class Ca and result set number 1, the second one
being an existence pattern, also on class Ca and result set number 1.

   The ELisp free variables _p1_ and _p2_ appear in the first pattern,
and _p3_ in the next one.  Hence these three properties may be attached
to instances of the the class Ca, namely objects _O1_, _O2_, and _O3_.
In contrast the variable _x_ is not bound in any pattern and hence not a
property of an individual object, simply a scalar--here
numeric--variable.

   This example rule fires when:

   * the variable _x_ is positive, and

   * both (i) all instances of class Ca have either a positive _p2_ or a
     positive _p1_, and (ii) some of these same instances have a _p3_
     greater than 5.

   The unification succeeds if these conditions are met and returns a
result set containing only one subset.  This unique subset is made of
all instances of Ca with a _p3_ greater than 5, and, by construction,
either _p1_ or _p2_ positive.

   For instance, let's suppose the ontology looks like the following
table:

Ca                 O1                 O2                 O3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
p1                 12                 -5                 2
p2                 5                  3                  -1
p3                 6                  0                  12

   Provided _x_ is positive, the first pattern is matched: all
instances of class Ca have either _p1_ or _p2_ positive.  Only objects
_O1_ and _O3_, however, match the second pattern with _p3_ greater than
5. Hence the LHS is true and the result set is the set:


     ((O1 O3))

   for further use in the RHS, if any.

   Now consider a slightly differently phrased rule:


     (add-to-kb
      (@if (and (> x 0)
     	   (and (all-in 'Ca 1 '(or (> p1 0) (> p2 0)))
     		(some-in 'Ca 2 '(> p3 5)))))
      (@hypo H)
     )

   Because the second pattern now mentions a different index than the
first one, the LHS is true of false under the same situation than the
previous one, but its result set now contains two subsets rather than
one.  The first one is the list of (all) instances of class Ca with
either a positive _p1_ or a positive _p2_; the second one is the list of
instances with a _p3_ greater than 5:


     ((O1 O2 O3) (O1 O3))

   These two subsets are indeed different as the following rule,
slightly edited again, shows:


     (add-to-kb
      (@if (and (> x 0)
     	   (and (some-in 'Ca 1 '(or (> p1 0) (> p2 0)))
     		(some-in 'Ca 1 '(> p3 5)))))
      (@hypo H)
     )

   We are back with a single result subset but now two existence
patterns on the same subset.  The LHS is now true only if among the
instance of Ca with either a positive _p1_ or a positive _p2_, some
also have a _p3_ greater than 5.  The two succesive patterns act as
filters, selecting a first subset of Ca's instances and refining this
subset with the next selection.  When the LHS is true the result set
returns those instances that passed both filters.

   Suppose the ontology looks like this new table:

Ca                 O1                 O2                 O3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
p1                 12                 -5                 -2
p2                 5                  3                  -1
p3                 6                  0                  12

   the result set of applying the later rule is:


     ((01))
   while the former rule would fail, the LHS would be set to false and
the result set empty. (_Exercize: Why?_)

   If the rule had been written with a different index for the second
pattern, however:


     (add-to-kb
      (@if (and (> x 0)
     	   (and (some-in 'Ca 1 '(or (> p1 0) (> p2 0)))
     		(some-in 'Ca 2 '(> p3 5)))))
      (@hypo H)
     )
   the result set for the later ontology table would contain two
subsets:


     ((O1 O2) (O1 O3))
   (_Same exercize: Why?_)

   As a rule LHS can alternate as many universal and existence queries
over the same or different result subsets, a rule may express fairly
complex queries against the simple default nclos ontology.

Writing Rules with RHSes in the Default Nclos
.............................................

As previously mentioned the unification result set is passed, when the
rule is fired, to the RHS which basically executes its sequence of
commands.

   The syntax of the `@set' RHS command has been extended to handle the
results of the LHS unifications.  The familiar syntax is, as a reminder:


     (@set VARIABLE SCALAR-VALUE)
     (@set VARIABLE LISP-FORM)
   which respectively assign a value or a computed value to the said
variable.  (This assignment may in addition trigger the forward
chaining mechanism.)

   Two new forms of the set command are available with the default
nclos:


     (@set (prop-in OBJECT-NAME PROPERTY-NAME) [ SCALAR-VALUE | LISP-FORM ])
     (@set (member-in CLASS-NAME INTEGER PROPERTY-NAME)
                      [ SCALAR-VALUE | LISP-FORM ])

   The first new form is used to assign a (computed) value to the
designated property of the said object. For instance:


     (@set (prop-in 'O1 'p3) 5)
   sets the value of the _p3_ property of object _O1_ to the integer 5.

   The second form is used to assign a (computed) value to the
designated property of all objects in the subset, characterized by the
class and index passed, in the LHS unification result set.

   A rule with a RHS:


     (add-to-kb
      (@if (and (> x 0)
     	   (and (some-in 'Ca 1 '(or (> p1 0) (> p2 0)))
     		(some-in 'Ca 1 '(> p3 5)))))
      (@hypo H)
      (@then
     	(@set y (+ x 1))
     	(@set (prop-in 'O3 'p4) (* 2 x))
     	(@set (member-in 'Ca 1 'p4) y)
      )
     )
   working against the simple aforementioned ontology:

Ca                 O1                 O2                 O3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
p1                 12                 -5                 -2
p2                 5                  3                  -1
p3                 6                  0                  12

   would evaluate its LHS to true, fire, execute the RHS side-effects
resulting in a final ontology modified as follows:

Ca                 O1                 O2                 O3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
p1                 12                 -5                 -2
p2                 5                  3                  -1
p3                 6                  0                  12
p4                 x+1                                   2*x

   (_Final exercize: Why?_)  Note that _O2_ has no assigned _p4_
property after the rule fires.  This is because _O2_ is filtered out by
all patterns in the LHS and not explictly mentioned in the RHS: it
never "meets" the _p4_ property.

   Remark: In the current implementation the new set assignment commands
do not trigger any form of forward chaining.  This is an interesting
avenue of research as there are several levels of granularity available
for doing so: object level and class level namely.

3.2.3 The OWL-Lite Object System in NClosEmacs
----------------------------------------------

The OWL-Lite nclos uses definitions and conventions from the OWL Lite
specifications for representing ontologies.  In this nclos, complete
ontologies contain classes, objects, properties and slots.  In contrast
to the default nclos, the OWL-Lite nclos supports inheritance from
class to subclasses.

* Menu:

* Objects in the OWL-Lite nclos::

Classes in the OWL-Lite nclos
.............................

A class defines a group of individuals that belong together because
they share some properties. For example, Deborah and Frank are both
members of the class Person. Classes can be organized in a
specialization hierarchy using subClassOf. There is a built-in most
general class named Thing that is the class of all individuals and is a
superclass of all OWL classes. There is also a built-in most specific
class named Nothing that is the class that has no instances and a
subclass of all OWL classes.

   Within an ontology, a class is defined by the following statement:


     (owl-class! 'Cb 'Ca)
   which defines the class `Cb' as a subclass of class `Ca'.  By
convention the rule of all classes in the OWL-Lite nclos is called
`'Thing' and must be stated in every ontology as:


     (owl-class! 'Thing nil) ;; Required

   The graph of all classes is thus a tree rooted in "Thing".

Objects in the OWL-Lite nclos
.............................

In addition to classes, we want to be able to describe their object
members. We normally think of these as individuals in our universe of
things. An individual is (minimally) introduced by declaring it to be a
member of a class.

   The declaration statement for an individual in the OWL-Lite nclos is:


     (owl-individual! 'Obj1 'Cb)
   which declares a new individual, `Obj1', as a member of the class
`Cb'.


File: nclosemacs.info,  Node: Properties in the OWL-Lite nclos,  Next: Slots in the OWL-Lite nclos,  Prev: Objects in the OWL-Lite nclos,  Up: The OWL-Lite Object System in NClosEmacs

Properties in the OWL-Lite nclos
................................

This is probably the place where differences with the default nclos are
the most important.  In the OWL-Lite nclos, properties are first-class
ontology elements and they are described and stated outside of class
and individual declarations.

   A domain of a property limits the individuals to which the property
can be applied. If a property relates an individual to another
individual, and the property has a class as one of its domains, then
the individual must belong to the class. For example, the property
hasChild may be stated to have the domain of Mammal. From this a
reasoner can deduce that if Frank hasChild Anna, then Frank must be a
Mammal. Note that rdfs:domain is called a global restriction since the
restriction is stated on the property and not just on the property when
it is associated with a particular class.

   The range of a property limits the individuals that the property may
have as its value. If a property relates an individual to another
individual, and the property has a class as its range, then the other
individual must belong to the range class. For example, the property
hasChild may be stated to have the range of Mammal. From this a
reasoner can deduce that if Louise is related to Deborah by the
hasChild property, (i.e., Deborah is the child of Louise), then Deborah
is a Mammal. Range is also a global restriction as is domain above.

   Hence the declaration of a property states its name, domain and
range.


     (owl-property! 'p1 'Ca 'Thing)
   The previous statements declares the property `p1', with its domain
being all instances of the class `Ca' and its range any instance of the
root class "Thing".  This states that any individual of class "Ca" may
have a property "p1" which value is any individual--as all individuals
are instances of the root class.

   If the property's value is a basic type (number, string) rather than
an individual, its range should be defined as `'Thing' anyway.  The
OWL-Lite nclos provides a special construct, called a _scalar_, to
handle basic types.

   In the current first stage of the implementation of NClosEmacs, all
properties ranges are considered scalar.

Slots in the OWL-Lite nclos
...........................

Slots in an OWL-Lite ontology are "concrete" properties.  A slot, which
has an individual id, associates a property with a specific domain
individual and a specific range value. For instance,


     (owl-slot! 'mySlotId 'p1 'Obj1 (owl-scalar! 5))
   assigns the value 5 to the property `p1' of the individual `Obj1'.

Ontologies in the OWL-Lite nclos
................................

A complete ontology is then constituted of four lists: classes,
individuals, properties and slots.  In the OWL-Lite nclos, such an
ontology is defined and asserted with the following statement:


     (nclose-use-nclos ':OWL-LITE
       (onto! 'owl-bench1
     	 ;; Classes
     	 (list
     	  (owl-class! 'Thing nil) ;; Required
     	  (owl-class! 'Ca 'Thing)
     	  (owl-class! 'Cc 'Cb)
     	  (owl-class! 'Cd 'Thing)
     	  (owl-class! 'Cb 'Ca)
     	  (owl-class! 'Ce 'Cd)
     	  (owl-class! 'Cf 'Cd)
     	  )
     	 ;; Individuals
     	 (list
     	  (owl-individual! 'Obj1 'Cc)
     	  (owl-individual! 'Obj2 'Cf)
     	  (owl-individual! 'Obj3 'Cd)
     	  )
     	 ;; Properties
     	 (list
     	  (owl-property! 'p1 'Ca 'Thing)
     	  (owl-property! 'p2 'Ca 'Thing)
     	  (owl-property! 'p3 'Ca 'Thing)
     	  )
     	 ;; Slots
     	 nil
     	 )
     )
   The function `nclose-use-nclos' is now used to install an OWL-Lite
ontology--rather than the default nclos, in which case its first
argument is `nil'.

   The ontology itself is defined within the `onto!' statement by its
name followed by the four lists of classes, individual, properties and
slots.  In this specific example no slots are defined in the ontology.
(Slots, however, may be defined dynamically during the inference when,
for instance, questions are asked interactively.)

Writing rules for the OWL-Lite nclos
....................................

The result of the independence between the rule and the object system
in the NCLosEmacs design is that rules are written the same way whether
for the default nclos or the OWL-Lite nclos.  *Note Writing Rules with
Patterns in the default nclos::, and *Note Writing Rules with RHSes in
the Default Nclos::.

   The scope of the LHS operators is expanded in the OWL-Lite nclos as
it supports inheritance. Hence the `all-in, some-in, oone-in, none-in'
patterns now select all instances of the mentioned class _and_ of all
its subclasses recursively.

The current implementation provides two interactive commands for
printing the current state of the ontology.

*nclose-print-instances*
     This command prints at the insertion point all individual instances
     of the selected class, and its descendant subclasses if the
     currently installed nclos supports inheritance.

*nclose-print-object*
     This command prints at the insertion point all the properties and
     their values for the selected object.

   Later implementations should provide a proper class/object navigator.


File: nclosemacs.info,  Node: Running a session,  Next: Implementation,  Prev: Authoring Knowledge Bases,  Up: Top

4 Running a session
*******************

The first step is to load the NClosEmacs engine (from Emacs) by issuing
the command `M-x load-file nclose.el'.  This basically loads the core
engine and initializes it for the current Emacs session.

   The preferred way to run an expert session in NClose is to open the
rule base text in a new Emacs buffer and evaluate its content with the
usual interactive Lisp command `M-x eval-current-buffer'.  This command
compiles the rule base and sets up the rule interpreter for a new
session.

   A complete expert system session is usually a three-step affair once
the appropriate rule base has been loaded.  There is an initial
volunteering/suggesting phase where the user is expected to either
volunteer some initially known data or focus on one or several
hypotheses of interest (or both).  The rule interpreter is actually
started with the interactive _knowcess_ command which triggers
interactive evaluation of relevant rules.  Once this second phase
terminates, log traces and various data exploratory commands are
provided to investigate answers and results reached by the inference
engine.  Other commands are available to restart a session or to
reinitialize the engine altogether.

4.1 Interactive volunteering and suggesting
===========================================

"Suggesting" is the process through which an hypothesis is posted on
the agenda for evaluation.  The rule interpreter evaluates an
hypothesis by collection all rules leading to the selected hypothesis
and evaluating them in a backward-chaining mode.

   Note that, in contrast to rules engines like RETE, all rules sharing
the same hypothesis are evaluated and implicitly or-ed to find the
boolean value of the said hypothesis.  In the default implementation
the order in which these rules are evaluated is left undefined.  Of
course, the backward-chaining evaluation function could be advised
should a specific sequencing of the rules or a lazy evaluation be
required for a particular domain application.

*nclose-suggest*
     This function is invoked with `M-x nclose-suggest' to suggest an
     hypothesis.  It works with the Emacs completion mechanism so that
     the usual `? TAB SPC' special characters may be used to select the
     hypothesis to suggest.

   "Volunteering" is the process through with a known piece of data is
volunteered to the NClose engine, usually before running an interactive
session.

*nclose-volunteer*
     This function is invoked with `M-x nclose-volunteer' to volunteer
     the value of a sign.  The user is prompted for the sign first
     (with standard Emacs completion available) and then for the value.

   Several suggest and volunteer commands may be issued before running a
session to provide initial information to the expert system.


File: nclosemacs.info,  Node: Knowcessing restarting and reinitializing sessions,  Next: Encyclopaedia,  Prev: Interactive volunteering and suggesting,  Up: Running a session

4.2 Knowcessing restarting and reinitializing sessions
======================================================

"Knowcessing" a contraction of _knowledge processing_ denotes the
process of running an interactive expert system session with
NClosEmacs.  Once the initial suggest and volunteer phase is completed,
the rule interpreter is started with the `knowcess' command.  User
interactions happen in the mini-buffer as the inference process might
need to prompt the user for information.

*nclose-knowcess*
     This interactive command invoked with `M-x nclose-knowcess'
     without argument.

   When a question is asked to the user, interactions happen in the
mini-buffer; the session may be aborted by typing `C-g'.

   The expert system session may be restarted at the end of the knowcess
phase with the following command:

*nclose-reset-session*
     This interactive command invoked with `M-x nclose-reset-session'
     restarts the expert system session, setting all signs back to
     unknown status and emtying the agenda.

*nclose-reset-globales*
     This interactive command invoked with `M-x nclose-reset-globales'
     without arguments reinitializes the rules engine.  In particular,
     all currently loaded rule bases are deleted from the production
     memory.

   There is also a less frequently used function:

*nclose-reset-signs*
     This interactive command invoked with `M-x nclose-reset-signs'
     unbinds all previously known signs.

4.3 Encyclopaedia
=================

The current implementation provides only a few functions to
pretty-print the list of signs and hypotheses with their values.
Gathered under the exaggerated headline of "Encyclopaedia" these
functions are as follows:

*nclose-print-wm*
     This interactive command which is invoked with `M-x
     nclose-print-wm' inserts a table of signs and their values at the
     cursor position.

*nclose-print-hypos*
     This interactive command which is invoked with `M-x
     nclose-print-wm' inserts a table of hypotheses and their values at
     the cursor position.


File: nclosemacs.info,  Node: Session logs,  Prev: Encyclopaedia,  Up: Running a session

4.4 Session logs
================

A complete session log is maintained in a special Emacs buffer named
`*nclose-log*'.  This buffer keeps track of the inference progress from
the initial knowcess command.  The buffer is erased with each reset
session command issued by the user.

   Note that logging is implemented as a specific aspect layer in the
`advice.el' file, *Note Aspect Oriented Programming::.  It is then easy
to switch logging on or off by simply enabling or disabling this
particular layer in the file.  In addition, more detailed levels of
trace are simply implemented by creating new advising functions for
events of interest in this layer.

5 Implementation
****************

This section describes in more detail some of the features in the
current implementation of NClose basic operations.

   The implementation of NClosEmacs relies on the underlying ELisp
interpreter in Emacs.  The primary design choice was to represent each
sign and hypothesis in rules as Lisp symbols, the value of which would
be the value referred to or inferred by the expert system.

   As a consequence of this choice, rules are Lisp macro forms which
call internal functions managing a few global (to the ELisp environment)
variables used by the rule interpreter.  Note that as signs are Lisp
variables, they are available in the ELisp environment available with
each Emacs session.  In other words, the inference engine and the
loaded rule base(s) are indeed available whatever the buffer displayed
in Emacs provided they were initialized and loaded in the same session.

   As a reminder, NClosEmacs is made available to the current Emacs
session by loading the `nclose.el' file with the standard command `M-x
load-file'; a rule base is loaded for interpretation by the NClosEmacs
engine by opening a buffer on the rule base file (`C-x C-f' or `C-x
C-v', for instance) and evaluating the buffer with the standard
interactive command `M-x eval-current-buffer' in Emacs.

   The interpreter relies on a global agenda, a first-in first-out stack
of hypotheses to evaluate.  Gating, which is enabled by default, is
responsible for posting hypotheses on the agenda as the inference
progresses.  (Further research might in fact unveil other inference
coprocesses that would interact with the agenda during an expert system
session.)  The essential interpreter process pops out the next
hypothesis from the agenda, stopping it it is empty, and passes it to
the evaluator.

   The evaluator implements a simple backward-chaining mode.  Rules
leading to the hypothesis are first collected from production memory.
All are in turn evaluated by attempting to pass their LHSes to the
ELisp evaluator (the `eval' function).  On a failure to evaluate due to
an unbound symbol, which in the chosen representation stands for an
unknown sign, a question is asked to the user and evaluation is retried
until it is successful.  Individual rules evaluations are implicitly
or-ed to assign a boolean value to the hypothesis, triggering the
corresponding RHSes if present.

   As previously mentioned, this implementation is also intended as a
base for further research.  A promising direction is to look into
advising each of the previous evaluation steps to evolve
domain-specific inference engines for vertical applications, while
keeping the general architecture and rules syntax of NClosEmacs.
Another direction of research is to investigate attachment of other
cognitive coprocesses to the inference itself, again using advising
functions in system-specific layers.  (Machine Learning and DDB/TMS
being prime candidates for inference coprocesses in the NCLose
architecture.)

   Finally NCloseEmacs runs in the Emacs universe.  It is only natural
that it should come with a rudimentary, at this stage, major mode for
authoring and running rule bases.  The current implementation, which
uses the generic mode approach, is only a first look into that
development.

5.1 Rules compilation
=====================

An introductory word about the basic data structures in this
implementation of NClosEmacs.

   In this version, the four global variables required for the
interpreter are simply implemented as lists.

   * nclose-global-signs is the list of signs collected by "compiling"
     the rules

   * nclose-global-hypos is the list of hypotheses kept in a separate
     list; note that an hypothesis might be a sign if it is mentioned in
     another rule's LHS (the `Yes' and `No' operators operate on
     hypotheses as well as on boolean signs).

   * nclose-global-pm is the list of rules currently loaded

   * nclose-global-agenda is the agenda, also implemented as list.

   Other global variables are possibly added by advising functions as
required for the operation of their layer.  This is in fact the case
for the gating and logging layers.

   ELisp offers several alternatives to list for the implementation of
the global interpreter variables: hash-lists, sequences, property lists
and association lists are valid candidates for alternative
implementations.  Furthermore, several extension packages exist for
ELisp and Emacs to integrate with external repositories such as
relational databases, file systems or remote servers.  These could be
explored in further research work.

5.2 Agenda Driven Evaluation
============================

The agenda keeps track of hypotheses to evaluate.  The initial
hypotheses are posted through the suggest command and, indirectly, by
the initial volunteer command.  Other hypotheses may be posted during
the inference process.

   However, when the evaluation of a rule finds a yet unbound
hypothesis, it starts evaluating that hypothesis at once, without
posting it to the agenda.

5.3.1 Introducing ontologies in NClosEmacs
------------------------------------------

Objects and classes were introduced in Nexpert Object as early as 1986.
The design of the original class and object system reflected the early
thinking on object systems which was barely emerging at the times.
Partly inspired from object-oriented programming languages such as
Samlltalk and C++, partly from frame-based and AI research object
systems, it distinctly had a set-theoretic flavor.  Patterns expressed
subset selections from classes or subobject selections from objects
following a classical element/set distinction.  On the other hand,
Nexpert Object supported a fairly rich inheritance system with
overriding, pre- and post- method executions, exception handling and
dynamic object attachment/detachment.

   In the current NClosEmacs incarnation, we chose to leverage
progresses made since then in formalizing the notion of _ontology_
which now sits at the core of the Semantic Web iniative.  More
specifically a nclos is based on a particular specification of an
ontology.  The default nclos, for instance, has a simple ontology
specification : classes are considered as sets of objects, each having
a series of scalar properties, with no inheritance and no complex
property types.  The OWL-Lite nclos, on the other hand has a much more
comprehensive class, object and property representation, with
inheritance and complex types --although currently the LHS pattern
language and the RHS commands have not yet been extended to benefit
from the enriched types.  The common ground for the formal definition
of ontologies in NClosEmacs is a structure made of:

   * a list of classes each uniquely identified by a name or id, each
     class may be attached to a parent class or to the root class (by
     convention `Thing').

   * a list of objects each uniquely identified by a name or id and
     attached to a parent class.

   * a list of properties, also uniquely identified by a name or an id,
     each with a scope--which is the class which instances it attaches
     to--and a range--which is the "type", a class name which instances
     the property's value is permitted to take.

   * a list of slots, each one attaching a value to a property for a
     given object.

   In addition each ontology has a unique name. (In the current
implementation only one such ontology may be installed.  Future
releases may offer better ontology packages handling.)

   This simple ontology specification is provided in the `ontology.el'
file.  This file contains the basic `onto-defstruct' ELisp macro which
can be used by ontology models to instantiates the class, object,
property and slot persistent records they need.

   For instance, the OWL-Lite nclos defines its classes as:


     (onto-defstruct owl-class ((:finder . id)) id subClassOf)
   which specifies that a class in the OWL-Lite nclos has an id, which
is unique and searchable for in the persistent store, and a
`subClassOf' which contains the id of the parent class.  With this
ontology specification--in this case defined as expected in the
`owl-lite.el' file--concrete OWL-Lite classes in a knowledge base are
declared with ELisp forms like:


     	      (owl-class! 'Thing nil)    ;; This is required
     	      (owl-class! 'Winery 'Thing)
     	      (owl-class! 'Region 'Thing)
     	      (owl-class! 'ConsumableThing 'Thing)
     	      (owl-class! 'Glen 'Winery)
   These declarations have side-effects and create automatically getters
and setters, testers and finders for their classes:

*owl-class?*
     Returns true if its argument is an `owl-class!' form.

*owl-class-id*
     Getter for the `id' name property of the class argument.

*update-owl-class-id*
     Setter for the `id' name property of the class argument. It is
     also associated to setf, so that the invocation `(setf
     (owl-class-id class) 'New-Name)' works as expected.

*owl-class-subClassOf*
     Similar definition for setter as above.

*update-owl-class-subClassOf*
     Similar definition for setter as above.

*onto-find-owl-class id list-of-classes*
     This function performs a basic search on the `id' of a class,
     returning the `(owl-class! ...)' that matches, if any, in the list
     passed as the second argument.

   These functions are used in the implementation of the adaptation of
the pattern language to the nclos in point.  They may be used by
programmers to extend the ontology services in NClosEmacs as well.

   All elements in an ontology model use the `onto-defstruct' construct
for their basic building blocks. *Note Adding new object systems::

5.3.2 Persistence and Volume
----------------------------

Issues of persistence and volumes are not addressed in the current
implementation of nclos models.  Complete ontologies are kept in memory
as ELisp lists.


File: nclosemacs.info,  Node: Variables versus Slots,  Next: Overview of the nclos API,  Prev: Persistence and Volume,  Up: Classes and Objects

5.3.3 Variables versus Slots
----------------------------

In the current implementation they are two types of scalar--basic
type--variables.  System-wide variables such as `X' in the following
LHS fragement:


     (> X 3)
   and slots, the value of which is also of a basic type, such as `p3'
in:


     (some-in 'Class-A 2 (> p3 3))

   In the original Nexpert Object, system-wide variable were
automatically updated to object type with special property `value', so
that the first condition would read:


     (> (prop-in 'X 'value) 3)

   Another option with the current implementation would be to consider
system-wide variables as local slots of a `System' object, so that the
former LHS fragment would in fact read:


     (> (prop-in 'System 'X) 3)
   with the same effect.

   The current implementation maintains separate ELisp variables for
each at this stage.  This precludes, for now, the use of system-wide
variables within the third argument expression of a pattern operator
such as all-in, some-in, and so forth.

5.3.4 Overview of the nclos API
-------------------------------

The articulation between the rule engine and the ontology management is
defined in the `nclos.el' file which specifies a set of ontology
related functions required by the engine for evaluation, selection and
execution of rules.  The most important are:

*nclos-slot-reader sym prop*

*nclos-slot-writer sym prop value*
     These are the getter and setter for a slot value, which is
     identified by its object and its property.

*nclos-slot-reset*
     This function reinitializes the list of slots to the original
     ontology definitions installed in the knowledge base.

*nclos-find-instances class*
     Retrieves a list of ids of all the instances of the passed class
     (recursively if inheritance is supported in the current nclos).

*nclos-find slots obj*
     Enumerates conses of property id and value for slots attached to
     the passed object.  This is mostly used for tracing and logging
     purposes.

*nclos-find-all-classes*

*nclos-find-all-objects*
     Returns as a list the store of classes or objects, accordingly.

   When extending NClosEmacs with a new nclos model, these functions,
and other ancillary functions in the same file, have to be extended to
accommodate the new model.  This can be done either by adding proper
code into the `(cond ...)' forms or by using advising functions.  In
both cases the `globales.el' and the `reset.el' might also require some
alterations.

   Usually the extensions of these functions make use of separate
model-specific files as is the case for instance for:

   * Default nclos model.  Refers to the `set-unification.el' and
     `set-instances.el' files.

   * OWL-LITE nclos model. Refers to the `owl-lite.el' and
     `owl-instances.el' files which rely on the `ontology.el' base.

   * EIEIO nclos model. Refers to the `nclos-eieio.el' file. *Note
     Adding new object systems::

   In contrast to the current (redundant) implementation, this
separation would allow to on-demand loading of the required code for a
given nclos model at installation time.  This is not yet the case in
this first pass implementation where all models are indeed available all
the time.

5.4.1 Overview of classes and objects
-------------------------------------

This section highlights the features of classes and objects in EIEIO
which are relevant to the NClosEmacs rule system.

   The class and object system in EIEIO draws its inspiration from the
CLOS standard
(http://www.ravenbrook.com/doc/2003/07/15/clos-fundamentals/) in the
early eighties.  Its architecture is different from the modern
"ontology" approach of the Semantic Web, best exemplified in RDF and
OWL.  Along the lines of the reference _The Art of the MetaObject
Protocol_, EIEIO provides classes, objects, generic functions and
methods.  The integration path discussed in this chapter is only one
way of articulating a NClos based on the ideas in _The Art_ but would
basically work for other CLOS-inspired ELisp implementations.  (See
also Closette
(http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/xlispstat/Src/other/closette/closette.lisp).)

   The integration proposed here is implemented in the `nclos-eieio.el'
file and supposes the EIEIO library to be properly installed in the
load-path of Emacs.  Its basic design options are:

   * Directly use classes and objects defined in EIEIO as classes and
     objects in the NClose set-oriented perspective.

   * Similarly to the OWL implementation, define an "ontology"
     abstraction; here simply to bundle classes and objects effectively
     used in a rule base in a namespace.

   * Map as directly as possible EIEIO-provided inheritance mechanisms
     to NClose inheritance requirements.

   These options simplify the integration work and reduce the amount of
code necessary to implement the NClos API to EIEIO.


File: nclosemacs.info,  Node: NClos class implementation,  Next: NClos object and slot implementation,  Prev: Overview of classes and objects,  Up: Adding new object systems

5.4.2 NClos class implementation
--------------------------------

The minor departure from classes and objects as required in the NClose
inference engine and CLOS-inspired class/object system is the set
oriented perspective imposed by patterns in rules LHS (and set commands
in the RHSes).  Operators like `some-in' or `all-in' trigger evaluation
on all instances of said class as their side-effect is to build the
list of matching objects to be passed to the rule RHS.  The classes
used in the rule system hence are required to keep track of their
instances.  Fortunately, this is easily implemented in EIEIO via the
use of the special class `eieio-instance-tracker', defined in the
extension `eieio-base' module.

   Here we chose to define a new keyword `nclose-defclass' to supersede
the standard CLOS `defclass' form for those classes which are used in a
NClose knowledge base.  This specific class definition form simply
attach the defined class to the root `eieio-instance-tracker' class
rather than the default one.  Its definition is simply:


     (defmacro nclose-defclass (name superclass fields &rest options-and-doc)
       "Defines a NClose class for use in the knowledge base.  These classes are otherwise normal EIEIO classes, with additional structure to integrate with the inference engine LHS patterns and RHS commands."
       `(eval-and-compile
          (defvar ,(util-s-cat name "instances") nil)
          (eieio-defclass ',name
     		     ;; Attach to a different metaclass
     		     ',(append superclass (list 'eieio-instance-tracker))
     		     ;; Add the required init forms for metaclass-inherited
     		     ',(append fields
     			       (list
     				(list 'tracking-symbol
     				      ':initform (util-s-cat name "instances"))))
     		     ',options-and-doc)
            )
       )

   Note that this form defines a global variable, called
`class-instances', for each new class in order to track its instances
as they are created and deleted.  This global variable is kept as the
value of the `tracking-symbol' slot for each class.

   With this convention, the set of instances of a given class is
simply:


     (defun nclos-eieio-instances (class)
       "Returns a list of the class instances, one level deep."
       (symbol-value (util-s-cat class "instances")))

   The methods in class `eieio-instance-tracker' are responsible for
updating the tracking symbol at each instance creation of deletion.

   Finally the ontology abstration is a class defined as:


     ;; Experimental representation syntax, inspired loosely from OWL-Lite.
     (defclass eieio-ontology ()
       ((onto-id
         :initarg :id
         :documentation "The unique name of the NClose class."
         )
        (onto-classes
         :initarg :classes
         :documentation "The list of CLOS/EIEIO class names in the NClose namespace."
         )
        (onto-objects
         :initarg :individuals
         :documentation "The list of CLOS/EIEIO object names in the Nclose namespace."
         )
        )
       :documentation "The ontology (super)class."
     )

   This simplistic class keeps tracks of all classes and objects
relating to a knowledge base.  It could be enriched and extended
towards a full namespace management with ontology-level primitives and
commands, for instance.

   Note that as NClose classes are indeed EIEIO classes, they may be
extended with generic functions and methods as for any other standard
class.

5.4.3 NClos object and slot implementation
------------------------------------------

With the class implementation in place, NClose objects are none other
than EIEIO objects, instances of `nclose-defclass' defined classes.
They are defined and used as would be any EIEIO standard object.  As an
example, here is a complete ontology form as declared in a knowledge
base file:


     (nclose-use-nclos
      ':EIEIO
      (eieio-ontology "Test ontology"
       :id "Experimental ontology"
       :classes (list
     	    (nclose-defclass Ca ()
     			     ((pressure :initarg :pressure
     					:documentation "Measure at T0")
     			      (temperature :initarg :temperature
     					    :documentaion "Heat Excess")
     			     (volume :initarg :volume))
     			    "Tank class")
     	    (nclose-defclass Cb (Ca)
     			    ((manufacturer :initarg :manufct)
     			     )
     			    "Subtank with identified manufacturing origin")
     	    (nclose-defclass Cc (Ca)
     			    ((duration :initarg :duration)
     			     )
     			    "Subtank with identified alert duration")
     	   )
      :individuals (list
     	       (Ca "O1-name" :pressure 200 :temperature 100 :volume 10)
     	       (Ca "O2-name" :pressure 200 :temperature 200 :volume 20)
     	       (Ca "O3-name" :pressure 200 :temperature 300 :volume 30)
     	       (Cb "O4-subtank"
                        :manufct "GE"
                        :pressure 200 :temperature 100 :volume 10)
     	       (Cc "O5")
     	       )
      )
     )

   This fragment shows an ontology with 3 classes, the first one being
parent to the next two, and 5 objects variously defined.

   Note that, in contrast to Semantic Web inspired ontologies, slots are
not separately defined as first-class properties like in OWL-LITE.
Here the slots are implicitly defined in the class specificaiton and
valued in the object declarations themselves.


File: nclosemacs.info,  Node: Query functions,  Next: Packaging for the NClosEmacs library,  Prev: NClos object and slot implementation,  Up: Adding new object systems

5.4.4 Query functions
---------------------

The get/set and query functions are the core of the NClos API
implementation.  Adding a new object system involves adding dispatch
calls in the `nclos.el' file to issue appropriate getter, setter and
query calls according to the installed nclos. (Which means, in
particular, that for a given knowledge base there is only one currently
installed nclos, namely the one resulting from the last
`nclose-use-nclos' call.)

   For instance, the slot reader should look like:


     (defun nclos-slot-reader (sym prop)
       "Get value of the slot identified by sym.prop, which may be unbound."
       (cond
        ((equal ':OWL-LITE nclose-global-nclos)
         (owl-property-reader sym prop)  ;; See `owl-instances.el'
         )
        ((equal ':EIEIO nclose-global-nclos)
         (eieio-property-reader sym prop) ;; See `nclos-eieio.el'
         )
        (t
         (let ((val (get sym prop)))
           (if val val
     	(read-minibuffer (format "What is the value of the %s of %s? " prop sym)))))
        )
     )

   and similarly for the other dispatch functions.

* Querying the Ontology::


File: nclosemacs.info,  Node: Reading and Writing Slot Values,  Next: Querying the Ontology,  Prev: Query functions,  Up: Query functions

Reading and Writing Slot Values
...............................

With the previous design options in place, the getter and setter code
for EIEIO is as follows:


     (defun eieio-property-reader (sym prop)
       "Reads in the scalar value of `prop' in object `sym' in the current EIEIO ontology."
       (if (slot-boundp sym prop)
           (slot-value sym prop)
         (read-minibuffer (format "What is the value of %s of %s? " prop (object-name sym)))
         )
       )

     (defun eieio-property-writer (sym prop val)
       "Writes value `val' to `prop' in object `sym'."
       (set-slot-value sym prop val)
       )

   Note that these functions may be advised, if required, to implement
additional inference mechanisms such as gating or context associations
on individual slots or objects. (In the current implementation, though,
it is not the case.)


File: nclosemacs.info,  Node: Querying the Ontology,  Prev: Reading and Writing Slot Values,  Up: Query functions

Querying the Ontology
.....................

Query functions are required for the encyclopedia commands to output
class and object descriptions.  They are also useful to implement
browsers and other visual representation of the knowledge base.  The
basic query functions defined in the NClos API are:

   * `nclos-scope-acc' used in LHS unification to create a list of all
     instances of a given list of classes

   * `nclos-find-instances' to provide a list of all objects in passed
     class argument

   * `nclos-find-all-classes' to list all NClose defined classes in the
     knowledge base

   * `nclos-find-all-objects' to list all NClose objects in the
     knowledge base, independently of their class attachment

   * `nclos-find-slots' which returns a list of consed slot value pairs
     for a given object (or object name) argument.

   As NClose inheritance abstraction specifies that instances of
subclasses are also instances of their superclasses, the firs step is
to implement a recursive exploration of the class inheritance tree to
produce all instances of a given class.  This is what the
`nclos-eieieo-all-instances' function does in a NClos-dependent way.

   An example implementation of the unification initialization primitive
for EIEIO classes:


     ;; Tail recursive implementation of initial extensions environment
     (defun eieio-scope-acc (specs env)
       "Initializes the initial extensions for rules evaluation in EIEIO."
       (cond
        ((null specs) env)
        (t
         (let ((ext (map-append
     		(nclos-eieio-all-instances (extract-class (car specs)))))
     	    )
     	(put env (extract-class (car specs)) (make-vector (cdar specs) ext)))
         (eieio-scope-acc (cdr specs) env)
         )
        )
       )

   The result is provided as the symbol plist for `env' which lists, for
each class mentioned in a rule LHS, the initial list of its instances,
called the _scope_.  As unification proceeds, the scope is further
reduced by filtering it out according to the LHS patterns.  The final
scopes are passed to the RHS, when all conditions are matched.

   The remaining query functions are somewhat simpler as they rely on
calling to the global ontology currently installed, an instance of the
`eieieo-ontology' class.


     (defun eieio-find-all-classes (onto)
       "List all class symbols defined in current ontology."
       (mapcar '(lambda (class-spec) (elt class-spec 1)) (slot-value onto :classes))
       )

     (defun eieio-find-all-objects (onto)
       "List all individual names (objects) defined in ontology."
       (mapcar 'object-name (slot-value onto :individuals))
       )

   Finding instances of a class is done as follows:


     (defun eieio-find-instances (class)
       "List all instances (recursively) of an EIEIO class. `class' is a symbol."
       (mapcar 'object-name (map-append (nclos-eieio-all-instances class)))
       )

   Note that the string-typed names of objects are returned here rather
than their raw vector symbol representation in EIEIO.

   Similarly for slots of a given object:


     (defun eieio-find-slots (objname)
       "List conses of prop . values for slots of `obj'"
       (let ((obj (find-object objname nclose-global-ontology))
     	)
         (mapcar '(lambda (x) (cons x (slot-value obj x))) (object-slots obj))
         )
       )

   Note that the argument here is the name of the object, as a string,
rather than the object symbol itself, hence the `find-object' query
against the ontology.

5.4.5 Packaging for the NClosEmacs library
------------------------------------------

The suggested packaging for adding a new nclos system to NClosEmacs is
to use the `provide/require' facilities for ELisp.  The NClos API
implementation would usually `require' the class/object library and
`(provide 'nclos-class-object-library)' to NClosEmacs.  The following
steps are usually required:

   * Implement the NClos API for the selected class/object library and
     use provide/require

   * Edit the mamefile to trigger compilation of the previous
     implementation

   * Edit `nclos.el' to appropriately dispatch calls to your library

   * If required, add specific keywords and commands to the NClose major
     mode in `nclose-mode.el'

   * Finally make sure the class/object library is in the load-path
     specified in the `makefile', with the make variable `LOADPATH'

   The library is rebuilt by issuing the `make release' command within
the NClosEmacs directory.

5.4.6 On the EIEIO nclos
------------------------

The `SATFAULT' directory in the release contains a revived antique
example of knowledge base which was consistently used in
demonstrations.  The `SATFAULT' knowledge base is provided in two
forms, one with an OWL-LITE ontology, the other with an EIEIO
implementation of the same ontology.

   In this EIEIO experimental implementation, the release benefits from
the tree visualization in the `tree.el' file.  This EIEIO-specific
features provides a basis for a simple _ontology browser_
implementation.  This simple browser is invoked through the interactive
command `nclose-browse-class'.

   For a given class, the browser shows the tree of its subclasses.
With the cursor positioned on the name of a class in the browser,
several keyboard commands become available:

   * `e' shows the documentation for the class, including its slots;

   * `x' lists the instances of the class

   (Additional commands will become abailable in further releases.)

5.5 Aspects
===========

As a practical research matter, this implementation looks at aspects to
support some of the NClose behaviors.  In the current version of
NClosEmacs, AOP has been investigated to develop so-called inference
"coprocesses", additional computing processes that occur while
inference is progressing.  The coprocesses we have in mind range from
simple logging of user actions and inference engine deductions to
complex machine learning algorithms or truth maintenance systems.  In
the current release we have experimented with using aspects, or to be
more specific context-oriented programming, for the NClose gating
mechanism and for logging.

5.5.1 The Gating Aspect Layer
-----------------------------

Gating is somewhat typical of an inference coprocess in the previously
proposed sense.  A generic inference coprocess is expected to rely on
some data structure, possibly dependent on the rule base, which hence
requires initialization and re-initialization with the expert system
sessions.  At inference time, the coprocess data structure is likely to
be used and modified as inference progresses.

   In the case of gating in Nclose, a record of associations between
signs and hypotheses is collected when rules are loaded and compiled in
memory.  This forward association information is implemented here as a
simple global property list.  As previously mentioned, ELisp offers
many alternatives for consideration as well.  At inference time,
whenever a sign becomes known its associated hypotheses are posted (in
no particular order) on the agenda for later evaluation.

   Since the aspect layers are all implemented through ELisp advising
functions, the later are then required at initialization and reset time
to create and set up the gating data structure, i.e. the forward
association property list; at load-and-compile time when rules' LHSes
are parsed; and, of course, at run time when the inference process
assigns values to unknown signs.  This is a typical advice layer
architecture as provided in the `advice.el' file.

   In particular the NClosEmacs functions that require advising
functions in this layer are:

   * nclose-global-init

   * nclose-reset-globales

   to synchronize the gating data structure and sessions,

   * sign-compile

   to capture associations between LHS signs and hypotheses at
load-and-compile time,

   * sign-writer

   to cause associated goals to be posted on the agenda when signs
become known at inference time.

   Using AOP gating is implemented with four advising functions at
minimal cost.

5.5.2 The Logging Aspect Layer
------------------------------

This layer exemplifies a cross-cutting concern where a much larger
number of functions in the implementation are concerned.  Depending on
the level of details required for logging a few, some or many functions
need to be advised in this layer.

   The current implementation logs these events:

   * start of the inference process (_knowcess_)

   * beginning of the evaluation of a new hypothesis

   * beginning of the unification of a rule's LHS

   * beginning of the firing of a rule's RHS

   * assignment of a value to a sign

   Of course, adding more detailed tracing facilities is a matter of
complementing these with new advising functions for events of interest.

   All events are logged into a special buffer named `*nclose-log*' and
available through the usual buffer commands in Emacs.  Note that this
buffer is emptied at each session reset and should be saved if required
for later inspection.

5.6 The NClose major mode
=========================

The NClose major mode, still pretty much work in progress at this
stage, is part of the default front-end to NClosEmacs.  The general
idea is that rule bases are simple text files edited in standard Emacs
buffers.  All major interactions with the expert system are designed to
happen from within these buffers.  Hence all user commands are
interactive Lisp functions usually invoked with the `M-x' prefix. Of
course, some NClosEmacs specific buffers, such as the log buffer, might
also be involved, or commands such as the Encyclopaedia may also work
in any buffer, but the main idea is that major user interactions are
centered around the rule base buffer itself. (Note: this might evolve
in later versions when classes/objects are added.)

   The NClose major mode, in its current implementation, serves as a
blueprint for a comprehensive expert system dashboard.  In order to
start from a simple base, this mode is, for now, derived from the Emacs
generic mode so as to experiment with various design options.  Its
major function in this revision is to font-lock hypotheses in the rule
base text to reflect the progress of the inference process.


     (define-generic-mode 'nclose-mode
       '(";")
       '("add-to-kb")
       '(("(@hypo[ ]+\\([a-zA-Z0-9\-]+\\))" 0 (hypo-facespec (match-string 1)))

          )
       '()
       '()
       "NClose-mode is a major mode for authoring and knowcessing rule bases."
     )

   As can be seen from the code, the major mode highlights the rule
definition keyword, and parses the rules source for hypothesis,
selecting a font according to its status (under evaluation, known true
or known false).

   Nclose mode is invoked with `M-x nclose-mode' when in a rule base
text buffer.  It is also, in Emacs fashion, automatically set for a
buffer if the first line of the file declares:


     ;; -*- mode: nclose -*-

   a standard way to tell Emacs to switch to the appropriate major mode
when displaying this file.

6 A Conclusion and a Starting Point
***********************************

The NClosEmacs implementation is both a valid and complete
implementation of the NClose inference engine, as originally thought
out more than twenty five years ago, and a new base for further
research work.

   New design choices, more specifically the leverage of the AOP and
context-oriented programming approach, which are investigated in this
implementation, open new avenues of research.  The emergence, in
particular, of inference coprocesses as a critical formulation of extra
features of the inference engine with the added benefit of an explicit
implementation technique through advising functions is one of the
remarkable facet of NClosEmacs.
